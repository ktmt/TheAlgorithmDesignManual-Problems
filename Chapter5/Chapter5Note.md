VietNH:

- It is recommended to use a well-designed graph data type as the foundation for your application: LEDA or Boost. 

- BFS uses two Boolean arrays: 'discovered' and 'processed'

- The exact behavior of BFS depends on the functions 'process_vertex_early()', 'process_vertex_late()' and 'process_edge()'
